          This part is just for my teacher so if you see this on the git repository [ Because i forgot to remove it ] thats why. So basically i started by just coding in all the html by its self. usually how i would do this is make one part of the site in html, then go add style and back and forth but thats not how it showed to do it. to start i made the basics of the header. Just the text and the nav buttons. After that i went onto making the front page with the reviews, the forms, etc etc. i then moved onto the about page which was more simple. Of course i added on this part at the end. But how i got the about Acne part was from the about page on the Planet Fitness site, with some changes. For the contact part of the site i just took the form from the newsletter and changed some stuff up. After that i moved onto the css. <br><br>I really like modern styled sites so i used a sans-serif font [Arial] and a black background with white text and some dodgerblue scattered around for buttons and the headers highlited colors (hope that makes sense). I basically tried to make it look as good as possible with animation, colors, fonts, and general things to make everything look good. And thats kinda it. The entire site took about 2.5 hours to make but im happy with it.</h4>
